This is a PowerBI project using the data of product sales transaction data.

**Objective:** This project aims to visualize profit data effectively to identify sales trend, analyze profit distribution, and product sales brand-wise. Here, I am analyzing the profit distribution as per the brand, product size, product line, order medium(online order or offline), etc.

**Data Cleaning:** Data cleaning is a must step before using any data for analysis or visusalization. So, using python coodes, I have clean the raw data. Major steps were checking the data types of data, finding missing values, filling or removing missing values, checking data incosistency and duplication of data.

**Dataset Overview:** The dataset includes transaction details of the purchased order. The dataset contains columns like transaction id, product id, customer id, transaction date, online order or offline order, order status, brand, and many more.

**Conclusion:** I have made the report in such a way that one can easily analysis every parameter related to the product sales or transaction.
