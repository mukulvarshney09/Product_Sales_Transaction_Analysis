## Objective
This project aims to effectively visualize profit data to identify sales trends, analyze profit distribution, and examine product sales by brand. I am analyzing profit distribution based on brand, product size, product line, order medium (online or offline), etc.

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step before using data for analysis or visualization. Therefore, using Python code, I cleaned the raw data. Major steps included checking data types, identifying missing values, handling missing values by filling or removing them, and checking for data inconsistencies and duplications.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset comprises transaction details of purchased orders, containing columns such as transaction ID, product ID, customer ID, transaction date, online/offline order status, brand, and more.

### Conclusion
I structured the report to enable easy analysis of every parameter related to product sales or transactions.
